            <p>More than 200 firms contributed to our request for ideas on what the global tech trends will be in 2019. Here's a synthesis of the main themes occupying the minds of the technorati this year. You may be surprised.
    
                This year it's all about data - a small, rather dull word for something that is profoundly changing the world we live in.
    
               New technologies, from voice-controlled speakers to "internet of things" (IoT) sensors, connected cars to fitness wearables, are vastly increasing the amount of digital data we produce.
    
             And artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and cloud computing are transforming the way we store, analyse and apply it.
    
            "In 2019 smart sensors will start to be found everywhere, automating data collection to satisfy the voracious appetite of AI," says Tim Harper, a former European Space Centre engineer and now founder of G2O Water Technologies.
    
             AI could be a powerful force for good, improving healthcare and combating climate change, for example. But it also presents many dangers - to democracy, to financial markets, to the belief in objective truth.
             caption Our world is digital now, but has that made it better or worse?
            Data in the wrong hands, used in the wrong way, could even threaten world peace, some commentators warn.</p>
